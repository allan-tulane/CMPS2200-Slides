As usual, code goes in `main.py`, and short answer in `answers.md`.\n","\n","\n","**1** Let's assume we're using the \"Map of Neighbors\" representation for undirected graphs. The provided `make_undirected_graph` function will make a graph using this representation given a list of edge tuples. \n","\n","We'll start by implementing the `reachable` function, which identifies the set of nodes that are reachable from a given `start_node`.\n","\n","As discussed in lecture, we'll maintain a set called `frontier` that keeps track of which nodes we will visit next. We initialize the set to be the start node. We then perform a loop where we pop a single node off the frontier, visit its neighbors, and update the `result` and `frontier` sets appropriately. At the end of the loop, `result` should contain all the nodes that are reachable from `start_node`.\n","\n","Complete the `reachable` implementation and test with `test_reachable`.

In this case, the loop to get the neighbors of a node (`for ni in graph[node]`) would be $|V|$ time in either representation, so the work would be the same.
