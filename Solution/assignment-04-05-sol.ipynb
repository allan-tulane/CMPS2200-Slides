{"cells":[{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"lz8TAHrTuK6D"},"source":["# CMPS 2200 Assignment 5 merged with Assignment 4\n","\n","In this assignment we'll look at the greedy and dynamic programming paradigms.\n","\n","**To make grading easier, please place all written solutions directly in `answers.md`, rather than scanning in handwritten work or editing this file.**\n","\n","All coding portions should go in `main.py` as usual.\n","\n","\n","## Part 1: Making Change\n","\n","The pandemic is over and you decide to take a much needed vacation. You arrive in a city called Geometrica, and head to the bank to\n","exchange $N$ dollars for local currency. In Geometrica they have a\n","currency that is 1-1 with U.S. Dollars, but they only have\n","coins. Moreover the coins are in\n","denominations of powers of $2$ (e.g., $k$ denominations of values $2^0$, $2^1$, \\ldots,\n","$2^k$). You wonder why they have\n","such strange denominations. You think about it a while, and because\n","you had such a good Algorithms instructor, you realize that there is a\n","very clever reason. \n","\n","**1a)** Given a $N$ dollars, state a greedy algorithm for producing\n","as few coins as possible that sum to $N$.\n","\n",".  \n",".  \n","\n","> The greedy algorithm is \"largest denomination first\", where we simply\n","take as many coins of the largest denomination possible. Once we can no\n","longer use a denomination, we drop to the next lower denomination. We\n","repeat this until we make exact change. This is possibly since we\n","have a coin denomination of 1.\n","\n",".  \n",".  \n","\n","\n","**1b)** Prove that this algorithm is optimal by proving the greedy\n","  choice and optimal substructure properties.\n","\n","\n","> We can actually prove these two properties together. Consider an optimal sequence of coins $o$ where $o_i$ denotes the\n","number of coins of denomination $2^i$. First let us observe that for\n","all $i<k$, $o_i < 2$. This is because if we took more than 2 of some\n","coin $2^i$, we could just replace 2 coins of denomination $2^i$ with\n","one coin of denomination $2^{i+1}$ resulting in a contradiction to\n","optimality. For denomination $2^k$ then the optimal must just select\n","as many coins as possible. But this is exactly the greedy\n","algorithm, and it is thus optimal. \n","\n","\n","\n","**1c)** What is the work and span of your algorithm?\n","\n",".  \n",".  \n","\n","> This algorithm has work/span $O(\\log  N)$. This is because for each successively smaller coin we reduce $N$\n","  by at least a factor of two, and the number of each coins of each denomination with\n","  one multiplication.\n","  \n",".  \n",".  \n","\n","\n","## Part 2: Making Change Again\n","\n","You get tired of Geometrica and travel to the nearby town of\n","Fortuito. While Fortuito also has a 1-1 exchange rate to the US\n","Dollar, it has an even stranger system of currency where any given bank\n","has a completely arbitrary set of denominations ($k$ denominations of\n","values $D_0, D_2, \\ldots, D_k$). There is no guarantee that you can\n","even make change. So you wonder, given $N$ dollars is it possible to\n","even make change? If so, how can it be done with as few coins as\n","possible?\n","\n","**2a)** You realize the greedy algorithm you devised above doesn't\n","  work in Fortuito. Give a simple counterexample that shows that the\n","  greedy algorithm does not produce the fewest number of coins.\n","  \n",".  \n",".  \n","\n","> Suppose we have coin denominations of $1, 5, 6$ and we want to make change\n","for $10$. The greedy algorithm would choose 1 coin of value $6$ and 4\n","coins of value $1$, whereas the optimal solution has 2 coins of value $5$.\n","\n",".  \n",".  \n","\n","\n","**2b)** Since you paid attention in Algorithms class, you realize that\n","  while this problem does not have the greedy choice property it does\n","  have an optimal substructure property. State and prove this\n","  property.\n","\n",".  \n",".  \n","> Let $C(N, k)$ denote the minimum number of coins needed to make change\n","for $n$ using denominations $0, \\ldots, k$, where $C(N, k) = \\infty$ if it is\n","not possible to make change. We first observe that the optimal\n","solution must use some number ($0, \\ldots,\\lfloor n/D_k \\rfloor$) of coins of\n","denomination $D_k$. If we use 0 coins of denomination $D_k$ in the\n","optimal solution then $C(N, k) = C(N, k-1)$. Otherwise $C(N, k) =\n","1+C(N-D_k, k)$, since we use at least one coin of denomination $D_k$\n","and then consider making change for $N-D_k$ with the possibility of\n","using more coins of denomination $D_k$. Thus\n","the optimal substructure property can be written as:\n","\n","$$ C(N, k) = \\min\\{C(N, k-1), 1 + C(N - D_k, k)\\}. $$ \n","\n","> Note that we can set base cases $C(0, i)=0$, and set $C(n, i) =\n","\\infty$ whenever $n<D_0$. For simplicity we can assume the\n","denominations are sorted by their index.\n","\n",".  \n",".  \n","\n","\n","**2c)** Use this optimal substructure property to design a\n","  dynamic programming algorithm for this problem. If you used top-down\n","  or bottom-up memoization to avoid recomputing solutions to\n","  subproblems, what is the work and span of your approach?\n","\n","> For the work, notice that the number of distinct subproblems is $Nk$,\n","and each minimization on the right hand side requires $O(1)$\n","work. This results in an overall work and span of $O(N k)$. \n","\n","\n","## Part 3: Edit Distance\n","\n","In class we proved an optimal substructure property for the **Edit\n","Distance** problem. This allowed us to implement a simple recursive\n","algorithm in Python that was horribly inefficient. We're going to\n","implement a slightly different version of edit distance that includes\n","substitutions, develop a top-down memoization scheme\n","and then implement a way to visualize the optimal sequence of edits.\n","\n","\n","**3a)** The code for `MED` from the lecture notes is provided as a\n","  starting point in `main.py.` We will consider a slightly different\n","  version of the edit distance problem which allows for insertions,\n","  deletions and substitutions. We will assume that insertions,\n","  deletions and substitutions all have the same unit cost. State the optimal substructure property\n","  for this version of the edit distance problem and modify `MED` accordingly. \n","\n","\n","**3b)** Now implement `fast_MED`, a **top-down**\n","  memoized version of `MED`. Test your implementation code using `test_MED`.\n","\n","\n","**3c)** Now that you have implemented an efficient algorithm for\n","  computing edit distance, let's turn to the problem of identifying\n","  the actual edits between two sequences.\n","\n"," Notice that in the process of computing the optimal edit\n","  distance, we can also keep track of the actual sequence of edits to\n","  each position of $S$ and $T$. Update your implementation of `fast_MED` to\n","  return the optimal edit distance as well as an *alignment* of the\n","  two strings which show the edits that yield this distance. An\n","  alignment just shows what changes are made to $S$ to transform it to\n","  $T$. For example, suppose $S$=`relevant` and $T$=`elephant`. If\n","  insertion, deletion and substitution costs are all equal to $1$, then the\n","  edit distance between $S$ and $T$ is 3 and an\n","  alignment of these two strings would look like this:\n","\n","  `relev-ant`\\\n","  `-elephant`\n","\n","Implement `fast_align_MED` to return the aligned versions of $S$ and $T$,\n","and test your code with `test_alignment`.\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"zBySxueCuK6I"},"outputs":[],"source":["test_cases = [('book', 'back'), ('kookaburra', 'kookybird'), ('elephant', 'relevant'), ('AAAGAATTCA', 'AAATCA')]\n","alignments = [('book', 'back'), ('kookaburra', 'kookybird-'), ('relev-ant','-elephant'), ('AAAGAATTCA', 'AAA---T-CA')]\n","\n","def MED(S, T):\n","    # TO DO - modify to account for insertions, deletions and substitutions\n","    if (S == \"\"):\n","        return(len(T))\n","    elif (T == \"\"):\n","        return(len(S))\n","    else:\n","        if (S[0] == T[0]):\n","            return(MED(S[1:], T[1:]))\n","        else:\n","            return(1 + min(MED(S, T[1:]), MED(S[1:], T)))\n","\n","\n","def fast_MED(S, T, MED={}):\n","    # TODO -  implement top-down memoization\n","    pass\n","\n","def fast_align_MED(S, T, MED={}):\n","    # TODO - keep track of alignment\n","    pass\n","\n","def test_MED():\n","    for S, T in test_cases:\n","        assert fast_MED(S, T) == MED(S, T)\n","                                 \n","def test_align():\n","    for i in range(len(test_cases)):\n","        S, T = test_cases[i]\n","        align_S, align_T = fast_align_MED(S, T)\n","        assert (align_S == alignments[i][0] and align_T == alignments[i][1])\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"hQ3kGFImuK6I","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1651095187387,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":134,"user":{"displayName":"Allan Z.
