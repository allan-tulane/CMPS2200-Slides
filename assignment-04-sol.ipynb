    "## 1. Improving Dijkstra\n",
    "\n",
    "In our analysis of the work done by Dijkstra's algorithm, we ended up\n",
    "with a bound of $O(|E|\\log |E|)$. Let's take a closer look at how\n",
    "changing the type of heap used affects this work bound.\n",
    "\n",
    "a) A $d$-ary heap is a generalization of a binary heap in which we\n",
    "have a $d$-ary tree as the data structure. The heap and shape\n",
    "properties are still maintained, but each internal node now has $d$\n",
    "children (except possibly the rightmost leaf). What is the maximum\n",
    "depth of a $d$-ary heap?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    ".  \n",
    ".  \n",
    "\n",
    "> $\\log_d n$\n",

    ".  \n",
    ".  \n",
    ".  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "b) In a binary heap the `delete-min` operation removes the root,\n",
    "places the rightmost leaf at the root position and restores the heap\n",
    "property by swapping downward. Similarly the `insert` operation places\n",
    "the new element as the rightmost leaf and swaps upward to restore the\n",
    "heap property. What is the work done by\n",
    "`delete-min` and `insert` operations in a $d$-ary heap? Note that the\n",
    "work differs for each operation. \n",
    "\n",
    ".  \n",
    ".  \n",
    "\n",
    "> `delete-min`: to swap down, we have to find the minimum of a node's $d$ children, thus $O(d \\log_d n)$\n",
    "\n",
    "> `insert`: to swap up, we only need to swap with the parent of each node, thus $O(\\log_d n)$\n",
    "\n",
    ".  \n",
    ".   \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "c) Now, suppose we use a $d$-ary heap for Dijkstra's algorithm. What is the\n",
    "new bound on the work? Your bound will be a function of\n",
    "$|V|$, $|E|$, and $d$ and will account for the `delete-min` and\n",

    "d) Now that we have a characterization of how Dijkstra's algorithm\n",
    "performs with a $d$-ary heap, let's look at how we might be able to\n",
    "optimize the choice of $d$ under certain assumptions. Let's suppose\n",
    "that we have a moderate number of edges, that is  $|E| = |V|^{1+\\epsilon}$ for $0<\\epsilon\n",
    "< 1$. What value of $d$ yields an overall running time of $O(|E|)$?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    ".  \n",
    ".  \n",
    ".  \n",
    "\n",
    "> The idea is to pick $d$ to balance the two costs. E.g., if $d=\\frac{m}{n}$, then the two costs will be equal, so we get $O(2 m \\log_\\frac{m}{n} n) = O(m\\frac{\\lg n}{\\lg \\frac{m}{n}})$. \n",
    "\n",
    "> If we assume $|E| = |V|^{1+\\epsilon}$, then we plug this in for $m$ to get:\n",
    "\n",
    "> $\\frac{\\lg n}{\\lg \\frac{m}{n}} = \\frac{\\lg n}{\\lg \\frac{n^{1+\\epsilon}}{n}} = \\frac{\\lg n}{\\lg n^\\epsilon} = \\frac{\\lg n}{\\epsilon \\lg n} = \\frac{1}{\\epsilon}$\n",

    "## 2. All-pairs shortest paths using Dynamic Programming\n",
    "\n",
    "In class we looked at the all-pairs shortest path (APSP) problem, and\n",
    "used a graph transformation so that we could essentially run Dijkstra\n",
    "with all possible starting source vertices. This resulted in an\n",
    "algorithm for APSP with work $O(|V||E|\\log |E|).$ Let's consider\n",
