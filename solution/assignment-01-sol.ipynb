    "> The main difficulty is in combining the results of the two recursive calls. To do so, we need to take the Result objects from each recursive call, and combine them together to make a new Result object. To do so, we have to take the max of the left side and right side. But, we also have to consider cases where the longest sequence spans the two sides. E.g., if the key is `12` and the two sides are `[6 12] [12 6] -> [6 12 12 6]`. Here, the longest sequence of 12s requires adding together `result1.right_side` and `result2.left_side`.\n",
