We'll next write two more efficient ways of computing $F_n$. In the first one, we'll keep an additional list called `fibs`, where `fibs[i] = F_i`, to store each value we encounter during the recursive solution. When the function is called for input $i$, we first check if $F_i$ is in `fibs`. If so, we simply return it. Otherwise, we proceed with the recursive calls. Note that we initialize `fibs` with -1's so we can tell if $F_i$ has been computed or not. Complete `fib_top_down` and test with `test_fib_top_down`. \n",

To do so, store a list of $n+1$ values, initialized to 0's, which will store the Fibonacci sequence up from $F_0$ to $F_n$. Write a for loop to fill it in, then return the last value.

    "`fib_top_down` and `fib_bottom_up` are two simple forms of dynamic programming. Both improve over the recursive solution by **sharing** solutions to smaller problem instances in order to reduce duplicate work. `fib_top_down` does this by starting with the original problem and caching solutions to smaller problems encountered in a recursive solution. In contrast, `fib_bottom_up` creates a table of solutions to smaller problem instances, and solves them from smallest to largest. In class and in the next assignment, we will see more complicated dynamic programming solutions where the relationship between smaller and larger problem instances is more interesting. \n"
