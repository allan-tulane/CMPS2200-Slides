    "The pandemic is over and you decide to take a much needed vacation. You arrive in a city called Geometrica, and head to the bank to\n",
    "exchange $N$ dollars for local currency. In Geometrica they have a\n",
    "currency that is 1-1 with U.S. Dollars, but they only have\n",
    "coins. Moreover the coins are in\n",
    "denominations of powers of $2$ (e.g., $k$ denominations of values $2^0$, $2^1$, \\ldots,\n",
    "$2^k$). You wonder why they have\n",
    "such strange denominations. You think about it a while, and because\n",
    "you had such a good Algorithms instructor, you realize that there is a\n",
    "very clever reason. \n",
    "\n",
    "**1a)** Given a $N$ dollars, state a greedy algorithm for producing\n",
    "as few coins as possible that sum to $N$.\n",

    ".  \n",
    "\n",
    "> The greedy algorithm is \"largest denomination first\", where we simply\n",
    "take as many coins of the largest denomination possible. Once we can no\n",
    "longer use a denomination, we drop to the next lower denomination. We\n",
    "repeat this until we make exact change. This is possibly since we\n",
    "have a coin denomination of 1.\n",

    ".  \n",

    "  choice and optimal substructure properties.\n",

    "number of coins of denomination $2^i$. First let us observe that for\n",
    "all $i<k$, $o_i < 2$. This is because if we took more than 2 of some\n",
    "coin $2^i$, we could just replace 2 coins of denomination $2^i$ with\n",
    "one coin of denomination $2^{i+1}$ resulting in a contradiction to\n",
    "optimality. For denomination $2^k$ then the optimal must just select\n",
    "as many coins as possible. But this is exactly the greedy\n",

    "\n",
    "You get tired of Geometrica and travel to the nearby town of\n",
    "Fortuito. While Fortuito also has a 1-1 exchange rate to the US\n",
    "Dollar, it has an even stranger system of currency where any given bank\n",
    "has a completely arbitrary set of denominations ($k$ denominations of\n",
    "values $D_0, D_2, \\ldots, D_k$). There is no guarantee that you can\n",
    "even make change. So you wonder, given $N$ dollars is it possible to\n",
    "even make change? If so, how can it be done with as few coins as\n",
    "possible?\n",

    "**2a)** You realize the greedy algorithm you devised above doesn't\n",
    "  work in Fortuito. Give a simple counterexample that shows that the\n",
    "  greedy algorithm does not produce the fewest number of coins.\n",

    "  property.\n",

    "for $n$ using denominations $0, \\ldots, k$, where $C(N, k) = \\infty$ if it is\n",
    "not possible to make change. We first observe that the optimal\n",
    "solution must use some number ($0, \\ldots,\\lfloor n/D_k \\rfloor$) of coins of\n",
    "denomination $D_k$. If we use 0 coins of denomination $D_k$ in the\n",
    "optimal solution then $C(N, k) = C(N, k-1)$. Otherwise $C(N, k) =\n",
    "1+C(N-D_k, k)$, since we use at least one coin of denomination $D_k$\n",

    "**2c)** Use this optimal substructure property to design a\n",
    "  dynamic programming algorithm for this problem. If you used top-down\n",
    "  or bottom-up memoization to avoid recomputing solutions to\n",
    "  subproblems, what is the work and span of your approach?\n",
    "\n",
    "> For the work, notice that the number of distinct subproblems is $Nk$,\n",
    "and each minimization on the right hand side requires $O(1)$\n",

    "## Part 3: Edit Distance\n",
    "\n",
    "In class we proved an optimal substructure property for the **Edit\n",
    "Distance** problem. This allowed us to implement a simple recursive\n",
    "algorithm in Python that was horribly inefficient. We're going to\n",
    "implement a slightly different version of edit distance that includes\n",
    "substitutions, develop a top-down memoization scheme\n",
    "and then implement a way to visualize the optimal sequence of edits.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**3a)** The code for `MED` from the lecture notes is provided as a\n",
    "  starting point in `main.py.` We will consider a slightly different\n",
    "  version of the edit distance problem which allows for insertions,\n",
    "  deletions and substitutions. We will assume that insertions,\n",
    "  deletions and substitutions all have the same unit cost. State the optimal substructure property\n",
    "  for this version of the edit distance problem and modify `MED` accordingly. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**3b)** Now implement `fast_MED`, a **top-down**\n",
    "  memoized version of `MED`. Test your implementation code using `test_MED`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**3c)** Now that you have implemented an efficient algorithm for\n",
    "  computing edit distance, let's turn to the problem of identifying\n",
    "  the actual edits between two sequences.\n",
    "\n",
    " Notice that in the process of computing the optimal edit\n",
    "  distance, we can also keep track of the actual sequence of edits to\n",
    "  each position of $S$ and $T$. Update your implementation of `fast_MED` to\n",
    "  return the optimal edit distance as well as an *alignment* of the\n",
    "  two strings which show the edits that yield this distance. An\n",
    "  alignment just shows what changes are made to $S$ to transform it to\n",
    "  $T$. For example, suppose $S$=`relevant` and $T$=`elephant`. If\n",
    "  insertion, deletion and substitution costs are all equal to $1$, then the\n",
    "  edit distance between $S$ and $T$ is 3 and an\n",
    "  alignment of these two strings would look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "  `relev-ant`\\\n",
    "  `-elephant`\n",
    "\n",
    "Implement `fast_align_MED` to return the aligned versions of $S$ and $T$,\n",
